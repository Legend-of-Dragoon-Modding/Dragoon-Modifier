# Dragoon Modifier for Emulators is Discounted
Dragoon Modifier has moved over to the Severed Chains PC Port. Any bugs or issues with the current Emulator version will not be fixed.
If you are using Dragoon Modifier for Emulators please try to keep to the final stable release of v3.5.5 as it has the less amount of bugs.

# Dragoon Modifier
The open-source version of the Difficulty Modifier, a RAM mod tool for Legend of Dragoon running on PSX emulators. https://legendofdragoonhardmode.wordpress.com/  
Using memory.dll for RAM reading and writing https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll  
and CS-Script as a scripting engine https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script  
Supports ePSXe 1.6.0 -> ePSXe 2.0.5, RetroArch with Beetle PSX HW core, and PCSX2  
  
# For Users  
In the settings tab activated scripts are in black text, deactivated scripts are in red. To activate a script single click the script to select it and then press the grey button on top of the script to change it's state. Some scripts require input, in this case you would double click it. The current script loadout can be saved or loaded by clicking Menu > Save/Load. You can change your emulator and region by going into "Settings" at the top menu bar. Once you see the following message "Program opened." Dragoon Modifier is running. Dragoon Modifier will only stop running when you see the following message "Fatal Error. Closing all threads." or close the program.  
  
# For Developers  
All scripts have the following four methods: Run(), Click(), Open(), and Close(). Run() is executed in the loop thread for that thread. Click() is executed when the user double clicks on the script. Open() is on program open. Close() is on program exit.  
For organization purposes, if a script is only done on the field/battle it should be in the Field/Battle folder. All hotkeys should go into the Hotkey folder. Anything generic or for multi use in field/battle it should go in the Other folder. If a script is specific for a mod you are making make a sub folder in on other the folders above. Dragoon Modifier will pick up anything labeled with a type of ".cs" within the Scripts folder.  
  
Also all scripts should start with their appropriate region codes. When switching regions scripts incompatible will be disabled.
